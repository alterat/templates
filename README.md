# Templates for various projects

Here you can find several pre-baked templates for different projects. 
They can serve as a starting point in order to avoid the fear of a blank page. 

## List of templates

- `html-js`: a simple HTML page with an empty JavaScript script attached. 
- `canvas-html-js`: an HTML page with a canvas ready for drawing images. 
- `nikola-post`: an empty post in RST for a Nikola blog.
- `flask-api-post-method`: the skeleton for an API in Flask accepting a POST request from Python.
